Domanda: Describe the TCP three-way handshake; explain which segments are exchanged between the client and server to bring them both to the established connection state (ESTABLISHED)


Llama 3.2 - Qwen - SemanticThe TCP three-way handshake is a process used by two hosts, a client and a server, to establish a reliable connection. The process involves exchanging four packets between the client and server.

Here's what happens in the handshake:

1. **Initial Client Packet**: The client initiates the handshake by sending an initial packet with the SYN (synchronize) flag set and its current sequence number.

   * This segment is often called a SYN segment.
   * Sequence numbers are used to ensure that the data packets arrive at the correct order.

2. **Server Response**: The server receives this packet, responds with a packet of its own containing:
    - The SYN flag set.
    - Its current sequence number.
    - The ACK (acknowledgment) flag set.
    - Acknowledgment numberset to thesequence numberof the receivedSYN segment incremented by 1 (mod 232).

   * This response is often called a SYN+ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) segment.

3. **Client Response**: Upon receiving this segment, the client responds with another packet containing:
    - The ACK flag set.
    - Acknowledgment numberset to thesequence numberof the receivedSYN+ACK segment incremented by 1 (mod 232).

   * This response is often called an ACK segment.

4. **Established Connection**: Both the client and server receive this final segment, confirming they both have correct sequence numbers.

Once all parties agree on the sequence numbers using the SYN+ACK packets and after exchanging ACK segments to complete the handshake, the connection state transitions from LISTEN to ESTABLISHED for both hosts.

The sequence of these four packets is crucial: 

SYN 
SYN+ACK
ACK

Each segment represents a step in this process.

Llama 3.2 - Qwen - KeywordThe TCP three-way handshake is a process by which the client and server establish a connection. The handshake involves exchanging four segments:

1. **SYN (Synchronize) segment from the client**: This is the first segment sent by the client, which initiates the connection.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment) segment from the server**: In response to the SYN segment, the server sends a SYN-ACK segment back to the client, acknowledging the client's request and sending its own SYN segment.
3. **ACK (Acknowledgment) segment from the client**: The client receives the SYN-ACK segment and responds with an ACK segment, which acknowledges the server's SYN segment and confirms that it is ready to establish a connection.

By exchanging these four segments, both the client and server are able to agree on the connection parameters, such as the starting sequence number (seq #), and bring their respective states from "CLOSED" or "LISTEN" to "ESTABLISHED".

By exchanging these four packets, both the client and server are able to establish a connection and agree on their respective sequence numbers (x and y). The final sequence number received from the server determines the starting point for subsequent data transmission between the two endpoints.

Llama 3.2 - Mxbai - SemanticThe TCP three-way handshake is a process used by two hosts, typically a client and a server, to establish a reliable data transmission connection. The handshake involves exchanging four segments: SYN (synchronization), SYN+ACK (acknowledgment and synchronization), ACK (acknowledgment), and FIN (finish) are not in this sequence; 

SYN 

- the client sends a SYN segment to the server with its own sequence number, typically chosen by the sender;
 
SYN+ACK 

- the server responds with a SYN+ACK segment, containing its own sequence number and an acknowledgment of the client's sequence number. The server is now in the SYNRCVD state; 

ACK 

- the client receives the SYN+ACK segment and sends back an ACK segment to confirm that it has received the server's sequence number correctly. The client is now also in the SYNRCVD state; 

The client and server are both now in the ESTABLISHED connection state, ready for data transmission.

This process takes place using a three-way handshake of TCP segments, allowing each host to establish the same initial sequence numbers, ensuring that data can be sent reliably.

To bring both the client and server to the ESTABLISHED state, the following segments are exchanged:

1. The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server.
2. The server responds with a SYN packet of its own, which includes a sequence number (SYNACK).
3. The client receives the server's SYN packet and responds with an ACK packet, acknowledging the server's sequence number.
4. Once both sides have acknowledged each other's sequence numbers, they are in the ESTABLISHED state.

The three-way handshake ensures that both parties agree on the initial sequence number and that there is no confusion about which party initiated the connection.

Llama 3.2 - Mxbai - Semantic_KeywordThe TCP three-way handshake is a sequence of exchanges between the client and server that establishes a new connection. The following segments are exchanged:

1. **SYN (Synchronize) packet from the client**: The client sends a SYN packet to the server, which includes the client's initial sequence number ( seq_num_client ) and a window size.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment) packet from the server**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, which includes its own initial sequence number ( seq_num_server ), the same window size as the client, and an acknowledgment of the client's SYN packet.
3. **ACK (Acknowledgment) packet from the client**: The client responds with an ACK packet, which acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK packet and includes a confirmation of the connection establishment.

The client and server will both reach the ESTABLISHED state after completing this three-way handshake:

* **Client**: Once it receives the server's SYN-ACK packet, the client knows that the connection is established and can start sending data. The ACK packet confirms to the server that the client has received its SYN-ACK packet.
* **Server**: After receiving the client's ACK packet, the server confirms to the client that it has accepted the connection and both parties are now in the ESTABLISHED state.

The three-way handshake ensures that:

* Both parties agree on the initial sequence numbers and window sizes.
* One party cannot initiate a connection without the other party acknowledging it.
* There is no ambiguity about whether a connection has been established or not.

Llama 3.2 - Gemma - SemanticThe TCP three-way handshake is a process used by two devices (a client and a server) to establish a secure and reliable connection over the internet. The handshake involves exchanging four packets: SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK, and optionally data.

Here's what happens during the three-way handshake:

1. **Client initiates the handshake**: The client sends a SYN packet (SYN bit set) to the server with its initial sequence number.
2. **Server responds with SYN+ACK**: The server receives the SYN packet and sends a SYN+ACK packet back to the client, containing its own initial sequence number and an acknowledgment of the received SYN packet (with ACK bit set). This is also known as the SYN+ACK segment.
3. **Client acknowledges the SYN+ACK**: The client receives the SYN+ACK packet and responds with an ACK packet, which contains the client's acknowledged sequence number incremented by 1 (mod 232).
4. **Server confirms the handshake**: The server receives the ACK packet and sends a fourth data packet (optional) or simply the ACK packet to confirm that it has received the ACK segment.

Once both devices have sent and received these four packets, they are both in the ESTABLISHED state, meaning their connection is now secure, reliable, and ready for data transmission.

This three-way handshake ensures that both the client and server have a common understanding of where to start sending data, and that they are both willing to establish the connection.

In terms of specific segments exchanged between the client and server during this process:

- The client sends a SYN segment.
- The server responds with a SYN-ACK segment.
- The client responds with an ACK segment.

Llama 3.2 - Gemma - Semantic_KeywordThe TCP three-way handshake is a process by which two endpoints establish a connection with each other. The following segments are exchanged between the client and server:

1. **Client**: Initiates a connection by sending a **CR (Connection Request) segment** to the server, containing a sequence number (seq=x).
2. **Server**: Receives the CR segment and responds with a **CA (Connection Acceptance) segment**, containing an acknowledgement number (ack=x), a sequence number (seq=y), and the MP_CAPABLE option.
3. **Client**: Receives the CA segment and acknowledges its receipt by sending another **CA** segment, confirming that it is willing to establish the connection.

After these three exchanges, both the client and server have established a connection and are in the **ESTABLISHED** state. The client can now send data to the server, starting with sequence number x + 1, while the server will respond with its own sequence number y + 1. This ensures that each party knows the starting point for sending data to the other.

Note: The MP_CAPABLE option is used in MPTCP (Multipath TCP) to signal support for multipath connections, and the DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) protocol uses a similar handshake process but with different segment types.

Cogito - Qwen - SemanticBased on the provided course material, I'll describe the TCP three-way handshake:

The TCP three-way handshake is an exchange of three distinct segments that establishes a connection between two hosts. Here's what happens in each step:

1. First segment: The client sends a SYN packet containing:
- SYN flag set (indicating this is a new connection)
- Initial sequence number x (extracted from the 32-bit counter)

2. Second segment: The server responds with a SYN+ACK packet containing:
- SYN flag set
- Initial sequence number y (also extracted from its 32-bit counter)
- ACK flag set
- Acknowledgment number equals the client's sequence number plus one

3. Third segment: The client sends an ACK for the received SYN+ACK, containing:
- ACK flag set
- Sequence number equals the server's sequence number plus one

After all three segments are exchanged and both parties acknowledge receipt (by sending their respective ACK), the connection enters the ESTABLISHED state.

Each host maintains its own 32-bit counter to generate the initial sequence numbers for these segments. The exchange of these segments establishes a reliable, ordered stream of data between the two hosts by ensuring that each host knows exactly what data has been sent and received.

Cogito - Qwen - KeywordBased on the provided course material, I can describe the TCP three-way handshake:

1. First segment is sent by the client (Client → Server):
   - The client sends a SYN packet with its initial sequence number (ISN) and an MP_CAPABLE option (if using MPTCP)

2. Second segment is received by the server:
   - The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, containing a response to the MP_CAPABLE option
   - This includes all information needed for the state cookie verification

3. Third segment is sent by the client:
   - The client sends a final ACK packet (FIN not used here)
   - This confirms the server's response and completes the three-way handshake

After completing this handshake, both the client and server enter the ESTABLISHED connection state.

The segments exchanged are:

Client → Server:
- SYN (initial sequence number)

Server → Client:
- SYN-ACK (response with MP_CAPABLE, cookie verification)

Client → Server:
- ACK (FIN not used)

The segments do not include the final data packets sent during the actual communication phase.

Cogito - Qwen - Semantic_KeywordThe TCP three-way handshake is a process that establishes a transport connection between two endpoints. Here's how it works:

1. The client initiates the connection by sending:
- A CR (Connection Request) segment
  * Contains a connection identifier and sequence number (seq=x)
  * This sequence number comes from the client's transport clock

2. When the server receives this CR, it sends:
- A CA (Connection Acceptance) segment
  * Contains an acknowledgement number (ack=x)
  * The server's transport clock generates its own sequence number (seq=y)

3. Finally, when the client receives the CA segment, it sends another CA segment containing a new sequence number.

This exchange of four segments between client and server is what establishes both endpoints in the ESTABLISHED connection state:
- Sequence numbers for data transmission
- Buffer sizes to manage incoming/outgoing data

The process is essentially bidirectional, with each endpoint confirming receipt before proceeding. The handshake completes when both client and server have acknowledged each other's CR/CA segments.

This mechanism ensures that connections are established only once and prevents duplicate connection attempts by both endpoints.

Cogito - Mxbai - SemanticBased on the provided course materials, I can describe the TCP three-way handshake:

The three-way handshake involves the exchange of three distinct segments between a client and server:
1. A SYN (Synchronize) segment is sent by the client with an initial sequence number (seq=x). The SYN flag is set, while no ACK flag is set.
2. Upon receiving this SYN, the server responds with its own SYN packet containing an acknowledgment number (ack=x+1) and a new sequence number (seq=y).
3. After the server receives this SYNS, it sends an ACK (Acknowledgment) segment containing the next expected sequence number (ACKnum=y+1).

By exchanging these three segments:
- The client acknowledges receiving the SYN
- The server acknowledges receiving the SYN with its own sequence number
- The server sends back an ACK to confirm it has received and is ready for data

Both parties transition from their initial states (CLIENT_LISTEN or SERVER_INIT) to the ESTABLISHED state. This process ensures that both parties have confirmed connection establishment, which can then proceed to send actual data (once the initial handshake completes).

According to course materials, this sequence of three-way segments exchanges between client and server is what brings them both to the ESTABLISHED state, which is a necessary condition for further communication over the established TCP connection.

Cogito - Mxbai - KeywordBased on the provided course material, I can describe the TCP three-way handshake and explain which segments are exchanged.

The three-way handshake is a protocol used by TCP for establishing a new connection. It involves the following steps:

1. Client sends SYN (Synchronize) segment to server
2. Server responds with SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) segment
3. Client sends ACK (Acknowledge) segment in response to server's SYN-ACK

For each of these segments:
- Client's initial SYN is sent from the client to the server
- Server's SYN-ACK contains a confirmation that the server has received the client's SYN and will acknowledge it when ready
- Client's ACK is sent after receiving the server's SYN-ACK, confirming receipt of the data

The exchange of these segments results in both the client and server moving into the ESTABLISHED connection state. The server must also send a COOKIE ECHO packet to verify that the connection can be used for resource allocation.

When the handshake completes, both the client and server are in the ESTABLISHED state, which indicates they have successfully established a reliable communication channel that can handle data transfer.

Note: This description is based solely on the provided course material and does not include additional details that might appear in other textbooks or resources.

Cogito - Mxbai - Semantic_KeywordBased on the provided context, here's a description of the TCP three-way handshake:

The TCP three-way handshake involves the following sequence of messages exchanged between the client and server:

1. The client initiates a connection by sending a SYN segment
2. After receiving the SYN, the server sends back a SYN-ACK segment
3. Finally, the client responds with an ACK segment to acknowledge the received data

By analyzing these segments, both parties can establish that they have successfully established a connection (reaching the ESTABLISHED state). The sequence numbers in each segment are crucial for avoiding duplicate connections and managing data flow between the two ends.

This handshake mechanism ensures reliable and secure connection establishment by requiring all three segments to be exchanged before any data can be sent over the newly created connection.

Cogito - Gemma - SemanticBased on the provided course materials, I can describe the TCP three-way handshake and the segments that pass between the client and server.

The TCP three-way handshake is a protocol mechanism used by TCP to establish a reliable network connection. It involves the exchange of three distinct TCP segments:

1. The first segment sent by the client contains:
- SYN flag set
- Initial sequence number (x)
- The client chooses its initial sequence number based on a 32-bit counter

2. When the server receives this packet, it responds with:
- SYN flag set
- ACK bit set
- Acknowledgment number set to x+1 (mod 232)

3. After receiving the server's response, the client sends:
- ACK bit set
- Acknowledgment number set to y+1 (mod 232)
- This confirms that the client has received and correctly processed the server's SYN+ACK

The three-way handshake brings both parties to the ESTABLISHED state in the following way:

- Client moves from LISTENING to SYN SENT state
- Server moves from INIT state to SYN RCVD state
- Both move to ESTABLISHED state after completing the handshake

After this establishment, data can begin flowing between the client and server. The initial sequence number is crucial for establishing reliable communication and detecting duplicates.

Cogito - Gemma - KeywordBased on the provided course material, I can describe the TCP three-way handshake:

1. Client sends an INIT chunk (SYN) along with a pseudorandom TagA
2. Server responds with an INIT ACK containing TagB and a state cookie
3. The server does not yet allocate resources to the connection

For establishing ESTABLISHED state, here are the segments exchanged between client and server:

The client receives the INIT ACK from the server. Upon receiving this packet, the client can verify that it exists by checking if the digital signature in the state cookie was validly signed with its original key (which is only known to itself). This verification confirms that both ends have sent their SYN packets, thus completing the handshake.

The first step of the three-way handshake completes by:
- Server receiving Client's INIT
- Server generating a response packet containing TagB and digital signature (as per RFC 1122)
- Client verifying this signature validates its existence to the server

Once this verification is complete, both the client and server can enter ESTABLISHED state. In terms of segment exchange during the handshake:
1. Client → Server: INIT chunk
2. Server → Client: INIT ACK containing TagB and digital signature (verifying Client's existence)
3. Client → Server: COOKIE ECHO packet (verifying Server's existence)

After both sides have confirmed each other's existence, they can proceed to enter the ESTABLISHED state by returning COOKIE ACK packets to one another.

In the ESTABLISHED state, the client and server are both capable of sending and receiving data packets. This handshake is necessary because the connection could not be established until both sides had verified that the other was willing to establish a connection and had agreed on its parameters.

Cogito - Gemma - Semantic_KeywordBased on the provided context, here's a description of the TCP three-way handshake:

The TCP three-way handshake establishes a new transport connection between two hosts. The process involves three segments exchanged between the client and server:

1. CR Segment (Client Request): 
- Sent by the initiating client
- Contains connection identifier and sequence number extracted from transport clock
- Protected by retransmission timer

2. CA Segment (Server Response):
- Received by the client after processing CR segment
- Contains acknowledgement of CR segment (ack=x)
- Indicates whether this is a new connection attempt or duplicate
- Marks the beginning of the three-way handshake

3. SYN Segment:
- Sent by the server in response to CA segment
- Contains initial sequence number (seq=y) extracted from its transport clock
- Begins the establishment of the connection

After all these segments are exchanged, both client and server move to ESTABLISHED state, and data transmission can begin.

Note: This process helps prevent duplicate connections and establish reliable connections between hosts.

The TCP three-way handshake is a process used by two hosts to establish a reliable communication channel over the network. Here's how it works:

1. **SYN Segment from Client**: The initiating host (client) sends a segment with the SYN flag set, along with its current sequence number (seq=x). This initiates the connection establishment.

2. **SYN+ACK Segment from Server**: The receiving host (server) acknowledges receipt of the client's SYN segment and responds by sending a segment with both the SYN and ACK flags set. It includes an acknowledgment number that is x + 1, indicating it has received all data up to sequence number x. This segment also contains its current sequence number y.

3. **ACK Segment from Client**: The client acknowledges receipt of the server's SYN+ACK segment by sending a segment with only the ACK flag set and an acknowledgment number equal to y + 1 (indicating that it has received all data up to sequence number y). This confirms that both hosts have acknowledged each other, bringing them to the established connection state (ESTABLISHED).

In summary, the three-way handshake involves exchanging SYN segments from client to server, followed by a SYN+ACK segment from server back to client, and finally an ACK segment from client confirming receipt of the SYN+ACK. This process ensures that both hosts are synchronized on sequence numbers and acknowledges each other's data transmission, establishing a reliable connection for further communication.
